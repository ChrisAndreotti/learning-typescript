# Learning TypeScript

This project is a sandbox containing TypeScript code examples, including:
* TypeScript basics (Primitives, Enums, Functions, Objects, Union Types, Any, Nullables, etc.)
* TypeScript compiler configuration (see tsconfig.json) 
* Using TypeScript with ES6 (Arrow functions, Spread & Rest operators, Tuples, Destructuring, Template Literals)
* TypeScript Classes, Inheritance, Getters & Setters, Static properties, Abstract classes, Singletons, and readonly properties

All content and instructions came from the excellent [Understanding TypeScript course](https://www.udemy.com/understanding-typescript) on Udemy.
